## Prerequisites

* Recommended machine settings: 1CPU / 2Gb per worker
* **Internet connection is a mandatory requirement for an "On-line**" **license**, thus the instance with pre-installed service must have internet access at least to [**https://lic.regulaforensics.com/**](https://lic.regulaforensics.com/) URL.

## Versioning

* the service wrapper version is `2`
